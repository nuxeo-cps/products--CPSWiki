Goals
=====

CPSWiki aims to provide a light, flexible Wiki for CPS, with all
features a wiki can give.


Features
========

- Automatic front page, based on the wiki content

- Automatic summary, based on the wiki content, that gathers all
  content in one HTML page.

- Page locking to avoid conflicts, the lock is done with a heartbeat technique

- Several wiki page parser engine for rendering:

  + HTML
  + reST
  + wikiwikiweb

  based on a plugin framework, parsers are extensible.

- Internal page caching

- Ability to upload files into pages


TODO
====

- Wiki objects should be BTree folders
- add a js warning on page deletion
- add UI to change page title
- add a merge proposal when a user tries to commit after a lock timeout
- add a link on history page so the user can restore a version
- add UI to manage Wiki parser selection
- add UI to add content in a wikipage (it's already folder so it's
  just a form away)
- add a zcatalog dedicated to the wiki -> until then, need to
  index content in general portal_catalog
- making something better on container view
- add UI to easily call CPSSubcription for wiki notifications
- add UI to import ZWiki pages
- add a PDF export
- setup RDF relations between pages, so relations can be made
  between pages, using keywords
- ...

- Platypus / Pytypus

  Platypus Wiki is a project to develop an enhanced Wiki Wiki Web
  with ideas borrowed from the Semantic Web.

  It offers a simple user interface to create wiki pages with

  It uses RDF (Resource Description Framework), RDF Schema and OWL
  (Web Ontology Language) to create ontologies and manage
  metadata.
