Platypus / Pytypus
  Platypus Wiki is a project to develop an enhanced Wiki Wiki Web with ideas
  borrowed from the Semantic Web.

  It offers a simple user interface to create wiki pages with metadata based on
  W3C standards.

  It uses RDF (Resource Description Framework), RDF Schema and OWL (Web
  Ontology Language) to create ontologies and manage metadata.
