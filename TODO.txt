From most to less important

* secure wikipages methods
* warn on page deletion
* add a link on history page so the user can :
    * view the diff between two versions
      use difflib.Differ instead of home made diff
    * restore a version

* add UI to manage Wiki parser selection
* add UI to add content in a wikipage (it's already folder so it's just a form away)

    * until then, need to index content in general portal_catalog
* making something better on container view
